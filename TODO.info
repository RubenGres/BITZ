Theses are the planned features for the future of the BITZ app, ordered by importance and priority.

⚠️ Most Important

- move main instance to a new NiceTrail's server
- update API keys to NiceTrail's account
- finish data backup pipeline
- Event page with separated species list / network
- Add subdomain filtering for quests

❗  Important
- Optimizing the database (atm it works but will be slow if too many users)
- Optimizing client (dynamic cursor loading on the map, paginated explore list, network text is slowing everything down, etc. etc.)
- Merge Amsterdam garden data in the main instance
- Cluster species labels to improve loading times in global network view
- Stop quest if too much time has passed or location is too far
- Make it clear when you are still on a quest
- Something changed, the prompts are not working as well anymore?
- limit API calls / days to avoid invoice surprises + archive version

👍  Nice to have

- download the data button in the quest view
- translation to GBIF DwC format
- In depth README documentation
- Refactoring of some of the client codebase (network graph)
- Location based information at the beggining of the quest (you are at...)
- update admin panel
- unify species relationship in graph (some are full sentences, other only words)
- rethink the relationships tone (relationship flavors?)
- Use LLM streaming mode to have shorter loading times

❓   New features 

- display number of found species during the quest ?
- user profile ? social features ? (oauth)

✅ Done

- interactions with previously found species panel
